# FlagAFlag

An application made for learning flags with the help of AI.
This repository contains code for scraping and augmenting the data.
This repository also contains models, as well as, modules for training them.

## Results

# Application and Implementation


Once the model was trained it was implementing inside an application developed using
Flutter. The implemented model was then evaluated over new images the model has not seen before.

This is an example of a classifaction using the application.

Here the crop feature of the application was used in order to further
reduce unnecessary data in the image. With the help of this function, the 
flag was clearly in the center of the image. This overall increased model 
accuarcy on unseen data
